# SimpleLinkedList
This is a NetBeans Java Project which implements a simple linked list with an object-oriented approach.

The Node class is the basis for building the Node data structure. This class will hold the data of a node and the reference to the next node. 
This class also contains a no-parameter, single-parameter, and double-parameter constructor. It also contains a getter, a setter, and a data retriever method.

The LinkedList class is used to build a functional linked list using the objects of the class Node as elements of the linked List. The linked list class contains 
some basic utility functions like a node data getter, a node data setter, a node adder, a node remover, etc.

A LinkedListUtility class is also created that adds some important utility functions to modify a given linked list. Some of these utility functions include a list reverser, a duplicate data node remover, a list sorter, and a list-to-array converter. 

This project is implemented in Apache NetBeans.
